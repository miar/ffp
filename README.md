Free Fixed Persistent Hash Map (FFP)

Steps to compare Concurrent Hash Maps, Concurrent Skip Lists, Non-Blocking Hash Maps, Concurrent Tries and FFP models in Linux:

1. git clone git@github.com:miar/ffp.git

2. cd ffp/benchSuite/

3. Open  Makefile, update JDK_PATH and JDK with your system values, close Makefile and do "make"
4. Results with execution times and memory used by each model will appear in the tmp directory
5. If you want to see how our model is implemented, you can check the ffp/ directory.

Thank you for using our system.
We hope you enjoy it.
